Use nest-fastify easier and faster.

This project includes: Nest.js, Fastify, Docker, NginX configurations, shell script file to run automated docker build and up process.

Configurations for `.env`, `HttpModule`, `exception-filter` has been included. `fastify-helmet` also.

## Prerequesites

Install docker and docker-compose.
You need to have Unix-like OS (Linux, OS X..) else, you have to run docker command manually.

## How To Use

Install and Run by following commands

```shell
# Install
$ yarn
$ yarn start:dev
```

- If you have DB, you have to add `ormconfig.json` which will be automatically ignored by `.gitignore` for security reasons.
- If you need environmental variables, just add `.env` to your root directory. No extra configuration needed.

When you need to deploy, just use docker-compose üê≥
The following shell script will automatically build docker container and make things ready.

```shell
$ chmod 777 compose.sh
$ ./compose.sh
```

Then you can see the result at "http://localhost:3000"
